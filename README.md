## Connor Worthington

I am a recent graduate, training as a developer and looking for a junior developer role that will challenge me and give me the opportunity to expand my programming knowldge. 

After graduating from university with a BA in Modern Languages, I moved to Vancouver and joined a software company, working as a data processor. Working in close proximity with developers on a daily basis, I decided to make the change and retrain as a software developer.
