I'm a Modern Languages graduate turned software developer. I recently graduated from Makers Academy which introduced me to the principles of OOP and TDD and am now looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

Having graduated from the Univeristy of Sheffield with a BA in Modern Languages I worked on translation projects before moving to Canada and joining a software company and working as a Data Processor. Working in close proximity with developers, my interest in the area grew and upon my return to the UK I chose to pursue a career as a developer.

## Skills

#### Detail-orientated

- Having worked in translation and data processing, I developed a detail-oriented attitude to my work and this is a skill that I have been able to apply to my work as a developer. 

### Team-player

- During my time at Makers Academy, I engaged in paired-programming most days and completed three engineering-projects, requiring close collaboration in order to be successful. This taught me the importance of knowledge sharing and being willing to learn from others.

#### Fast-learner

- I recently graduated from a 16-week developer bootcamp, during which time I was introduced to a number of new technologies, which I had to learn and apply when building three team-based engineering projects.
